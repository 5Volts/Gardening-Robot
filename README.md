Are you tired of going outside to water and maintain your vegetable? Do you wish to have your backyard greenery stay healthy with just the push of a button? Today we'll make a remote-controlled robot that is designed to make your life easier.

Remember to change the pin numbers in the arduino code to suit your needs.

The app can be found on play store called Bluetooth RC Controller
